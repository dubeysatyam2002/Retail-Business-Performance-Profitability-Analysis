# 📊 Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail transactional data to identify **profit-draining categories**, **slow-moving inventory**, and **seasonal sales behavior**. Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, the project delivers actionable business insights through data-driven analysis and interactive visualizations.

The goal is to simulate a real-world retail analytics workflow and demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills suitable for a Data Analyst role.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze category and sub-category profitability
- Identify loss-making and low-margin products
- Simulate inventory turnover and detect slow-moving items
- Study seasonal sales and profit trends
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for business stakeholders
- Provide strategic insights for inventory and profit optimization

## 🔍 Steps Involved in the Project

### 1️⃣ Data Import & Cleaning (SQL)
- Imported CSV data into SQLite using DB Browser
- Checked for missing and invalid values
- Created a cleaned dataset while retaining loss-making transactions for analysis

### 2️⃣ Profitability Analysis (SQL)
- Calculated total sales and profit by category and sub-category
- Computed profit margin percentages
- Identified profit-draining and low-margin product segments

### 3️⃣ Inventory Turnover Proxy & Correlation (Python)
- Simulated inventory movement using total quantity sold
- Created an inventory days proxy to identify slow-moving products
- Analyzed correlation between inventory movement and profitability
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots

### 4️⃣ Seasonal Analysis & Dashboard (Tableau)
- Analyzed monthly sales and profit trends
- Identified seasonal peaks and low-margin periods
- Built an interactive dashboard with filters for:
  - Region
  - Category
  - Sub-Category
- Exported dashboard as PDF for reporting

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- High sales do not always guarantee high profitability
- Certain sub-categories consistently generate losses
- Slow-moving products are strongly associated with lower profitability
- Seasonal spikes in sales often show reduced profit margins
- Inventory optimization and pricing strategies can improve margins

---

## 📊 Deliverables

- ✅ SQL Queries File (`.sql`)
- ✅ Python Analysis Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- ✅ Interactive Tableau Dashboard (`.twbx`)
- ✅ Dashboard PDF Report
- ✅ Business Insights Documentation

---

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

- Re-evaluate pricing and discount strategies for low-margin products
- Reduce overstock of slow-moving inventory
- Focus on high-margin categories during peak seasons
- Align inventory planning with seasonal demand patterns

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with SQL-based business analysis
- Practical application of Python for analytical modeling
- Tableau dashboard design for stakeholder communication
- Real-world retail analytics problem-solving approach
